# zm-tattletale

## Synopsis
zm-tattletale is a small python client which connects to a ZoneMinder event server, and creates notifications of varying types to alert the user to new ZoneMinder events.


## Motivation
I pay more attention to my computer than my phone, so I needed a way to maintain my constant paranoid awareness while I was away from my phone (immersed in my computer), so I wrote this.

## Warnings
This software is no good yet. It needs a lot of polish and some TLC. User beware.

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Windows *FIXME: multiplatform support*
* ZoneMinder 1.28.107 or greater
* [zmeventserver] (https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventserver)
